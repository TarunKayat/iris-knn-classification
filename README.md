# Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

ðŸš€ A simple and effective Machine Learning project using the classic Iris dataset to classify flower species using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

In this project, I:
- Loaded the Iris dataset from `scikit-learn`
- Visualized accuracy across different values of `k` (number of neighbors)
- Selected the best `k` based on model performance
- Evaluated model accuracy using a test set

## ðŸ§  What is KNN?

**K-Nearest Neighbors** is a supervised ML algorithm used for classification and regression. It classifies data points based on the majority class among its nearest neighbors.
